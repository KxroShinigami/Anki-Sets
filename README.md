For time saving purposes i used the Anki Extension <a href = "https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778">CrowdAnki</a> for automatic export into the Folder /CrowdAnki_JSON_Decks. You have to use the extension too to import the Json Files. The apkg-Files are not planned to be updated further more. Thx.
